# Sorry Card Drawer
A simple day project that came to mind when I was playing the game Sorry. In the game, as players draw cards from the deck, it becomes increasingly more likely for a sorry to be drawn if a sorry hasn't already been drawn. This changed the player's strategy to play defensively towards the end of said decks. I wondered what would Sorry look like with truly random combinations, i.e. drawing from a deck with replacement.
